This is an unfinished game.  Please fork and finish the story.

The game starts with you managing a tv station.  Your job is to buy and schedule movies so you win the prime time viewing battle.

This is written with Laravel 8 using Breeze starter package with VueJs and TailWinds.  The cool styling is from the daisyui tailwinds plugin.
